It's a part of the R-Ladies Nijmegen workshop series, and includes examples + do-it-yourself exercises on how to create effective and beautiful plots using ggplot2, as well as some other neat packages. 
You'll learn how to present your raw data in different ways to make the best of your graphs, how to plot your summarized data, and how to visualize your regression models' results. There is also a quick refresher on how to use R Markdown.
